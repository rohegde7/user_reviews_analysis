Step 1:
        Read the excel file and store it in the form of a DataFrame object
Step 2:
        Calculate the shape of the DataFrame
Step 3:
        Read the reviews, break it down into individual reviews and store it as an individual element in a list
Step 4:

Step 5:
        Set the counters for all the review factors as zero
Step 6:
        Create a dictionary to make a key-value pair of the keywords and it's occurance counters
Step 7:
        Search for the key in the list and match it with the required reviews and store it in the dictionary along with it's count
Step 8:
        For plotting the graph use the matplotlib library
Step 9:
        Append all the required labels in one list, calculate the required rows and columns and plot the bar graph
Step 10:
